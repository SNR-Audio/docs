### All you need to know about Audio Encoding Formats 



<Tabs>
  <Tab title="PCM">
   <b>PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)</b> is a digital representation of analog signals, widely used in audio and telecommunications. It converts analog signals, such as sound waves, into digital form by sampling the signal at regular intervals and quantizing the sampled values.

  <Tab title="MP3">
    <b>MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III)</b> is a widely-used audio encoding format that efficiently compresses and encodes audio data using lossy compression techniques. Developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), MP3 aims to reduce the size of audio files while maintaining an acceptable level of audio quality.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="AAC">
   <b> AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)</b> is a widely used audio encoding format, designed as a successor to MP3. AAC achieves better sound quality than MP3 at similar bit rates, making it a popular choice for music streaming services, digital radio, and video games.

  <Tab title="Opus">
     <b>Opus</b> is a versatile and open-source audio encoding format designed for low-latency, real-time communication, such as VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), videoconferencing, and in-game chat. It combines the strengths of two codecs: the speech-oriented SILK and the music-oriented CELT.

  <Tab title="μ-law">
   <b>Mu-Law (μ-Law)</b> is a companding algorithm used in digital telecommunications, such as Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in voice communications. It is primarily used in North America and Japan.
